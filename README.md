The study aims to simulate disease spread using cellular automata and evaluate intervention effectiveness. By considering infection probabilities, research provides insights into evolving transmission patterns under various conditions.

Airborne infectious diseases present global health challenges, characterized by their
rapid and unpredictable spread. Accurate modelling and forecasting tools are crucial
for understanding disease dynamics and evaluating intervention strategies. Cellular
automata, a powerful tool, have emerged for simulating disease spread within
populations. This report focuses on using cellular automata to model airborne
infectious diseases and analyse different scenarios for disease control.

Diseases like influenza, COVID-19, and tuberculosis spread via respiratory droplets
and aerosols, leading to complex transmission patterns. Cellular automata offer a
novel approach by representing states of a country in cells, enabling detailed
exploration of disease dynamics. Unlike traditional models, cellular automata
capture individual interactions and intervention impacts simultaneously, aiding
decision-making for effective public health strategies.
